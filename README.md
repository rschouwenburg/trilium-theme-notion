# Notion-like theme for Trilium Notes

This theme aims to create a more consistent typographic experience for
Trilium Notes. It borrows heavily from Notion to achieve this.

[Trilium](https://github.com/zadam/trilium) is a great personal note taking app if you need something more
powerful than your run-of-the-mill default note taking app out there.

## Install

To install the theme, take the following steps:

1. create a new note in Trilium of type **CSS** and name it "notion-theme"
1. copy the contents of [style.css](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rschouwenburg/trilium-theme-notion/main/style.css) into the new note
1. add `#appTheme=[notion-theme]` attribute to the note
1. go to Menu -> Options and select "notion-theme" as your theme (this will reload the window)
